= Highrise Contact

This is a radiant extension that allows you to hookup a contact form and submit the form to a highrise account.

To Install:

This extension is not registered with the radiant extension site, so you must install it manually.

Here is more information on how to install an extension manually: http://github.com/radiant/radiant/wiki/installing-extensions

Usage:

Once installed you need to set your highrise authentication token and company subdomain.  The extension adds a settings
tab that you can enter those values.  You can optionally also specify the user and task category that you want tasks
assigned to.

On one of your pages you need to include the following tag:
<r:highrise-contact />

This will create a form for you to submit contact information to highrise.  (Yes it really is that easy.)


If the contact exists (by email) then we ignore the contact fields and load the contact already in Highrise.
If the contact does not exist (by email) then we add it with all the provided contact information.

What fields and how it is put into highrise is affected by the contact_type parameter: There are four variations on the forms that you can use.

# this causes the form to create a web support case and a task on the case
  WEB_SUPPORT = "Web Support"
  # this causes the form to create a web lead and a task on the person or address if provided
  WEB_LEAD = "Web Lead"
  # this causes the form to create a retail lead and a task on the person or address if provided
  WEB_RETAIL_LEAD = "Retail Lead"
  # this causes the form to simply put the user into highrise and tag them as Web Opt In
  WEB_OPT_IN = "Web Opt In"

* FORM TYPES *
